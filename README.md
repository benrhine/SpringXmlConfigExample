SpringXmlConfigExample
======================

A Simple Spring MVC application with XML configuration and a complete test suite

For me this is more of a memory aide as well as a learning tool.  I wanted to have a fully tested template web application to jumpstart any future projects for work as well as being able to easily reference things that I have learned or just want to remember.
