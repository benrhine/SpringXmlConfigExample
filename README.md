SpringXmlConfigExample
======================

A Simple Spring MVC application with XML configuration and a complete test suite

For me this is more of a memory aide as well as a learning tool.  I wanted to have a fully tested template web application to jumpstart any future projects for work as well as being able to easily reference things that I have learned or just want to remember.  This will be the first template program in a series I am working on in my free time, I hope to soon have four of these examples.

Spring MVC with XML Config
Spring MVC with Java Config
Spring MVC with Groovy on Grails
Spring MVC with Scala
